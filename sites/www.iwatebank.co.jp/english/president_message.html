            <p>
              Three and a half years have passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred. Although “restoration and reconstruction” is making gradual progress in the affected areas, there are concerns that problems faced the regional community, such as a decreasing birthrate, aging society and declining population, may worsen rapidly and that the market that forms the Bank’s base of operations will shrink, depending on how the reconstruction situation develops and other factors. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In light of these circumstances, in April of last year the Bank formulated the long-term vision “Demonstrating a dominant presence as a driving force in the region, while establishing our position as a top quality bank” as a commitment for the next 10 years and launched its three-year medium-term management plan “Iwagin Frontier Plan – Reconstruction and Creation, toward a Prosperous Future” as the first stage of that vision. Under the three basic policies of “Active contribution to the revitalization of the regional community,” “Reform of the organization and earnings structure to enhance profitability,” and “Strengthening of CS activities and fostering of human resources” of the plan, the Bank will not only strongly support reconstruction of the region but also focus its energies on nurturing and promoting new industries to support the next generation in order to be actively involved in the reconstruction and development of the local economy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In fiscal 2013, we were able to secure an income level above the initial plan as a result of concerted efforts made by officers and employees to press ahead with the medium-term management plan. In fiscal 2014 as well, the second year of the plan, we intend to untiringly and expeditiously work toward completing the plan. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the top regional bank, we recognize that recovery from the disaster is our responsibility and our greatest mission. We are committed to supporting the reconstruction of the region and creating a prosperous future by making full use of our relationship banking function and being a proactive driver of the local economy.
